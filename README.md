The proposed IoT-enabled water management system integrates real-time monitoring 
of water quality and tank levels to ensure safe and efficient distribution. Using 
electrochemical analysis, the system detects the water quality by detecting bacterial contamination, such as E. coli, 
through Specially coated electrodes that measure changes in conductivity caused by 
bacteria..Contamination levels and Water 
level(overflow or low water) are displayed via local display ,the data is sent to 
the Corporation.The Website/app developed by us will provide data collection,accurate monitoring and alert  providing. Thus Actionable insights on water treatment or usage.
The Portable Kit tests the presence of  bacteria and microbial contaminants using Electro chemical Analysis technique(EAT).
It Indicates the presence of microbes by analyzing Change in Current in the electrical cell.
When the electrodes of the cell kept in touch with water, the change in conductivity due to bacteria is observed and compared with threshold value and indicates the contamination level.
The different LED indications denotes the bacterial concentration in the water .
The oled display shows real time bacteria content.
In the website it shows the amount of bacteria in the water and it is recyclable or not.
